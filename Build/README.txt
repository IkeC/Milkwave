Milkwave - Remote controlled MilkDrop2 Visualizer

MilkwaveRemote.exe: 
The main program. When you start this, MilkwaveVisualizer.exe will be started automatically.

MilkwaveVisualizer.exe: 
The visualizer window. You may run and use this independent without the Remote.

settings.ini:
Settings for the Visualizer. Feel free to edit.

settings-milkwave.json:
Settings for the Remote. Feel free to edit.

sprites.ini:
Sprites definition file for the visualizer. To display your own images, you must add a definition in this file and put the image in resources\sprites. You can trigger them by typing 00..99 in the visualizer window when Sprite Mode is selected, or using the number buttons on the Remote.

messages.ini:
Messages definition file for the visualizer. This is the standard MilkDrop way to display pre-defined messages. You can trigger them by typing 00..99 in the visualizer window when Message Mode is selected. Using the Remote messaging features is more flexible and works in either mode, but this still works great eg. for assigning certain messages to fixed buttons.
