# Precompile the following shaders on Visualizer startup if:
#
# - ShaderCaching=1 is set in settings.ini (default)
# - ShaderPrecompileOnStartup=1 is set in settings.ini (default)
# - The file cache\compiled.txt does not exist
#
# You can remove or empty the cache folder safely anytime. Use relative or 
# absolute paths for the presets. The base directory for relative paths is 
# the Milkwave directory. You can put an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to include 
# all contents of a directory.
#
# A list of compiled files, along with compilation time per file in 
# milliseconds, are written to cache\compiled.txt.
