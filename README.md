# BeatDrop Music Visualizer

One standalone visualization, one improvement.
In this repo will fix the bug, adding new features and more stuff to BeatDrop Music Visualizer.
- This is a continued development because the original developer, Maxim Volskiy (@mvsoft74) has gone silent.

Things fixed:
* The y/n decision bug
* Keyboard function changes (F4: Show Preset Info, F5: Show FPS, F6: Show Rating, F1: Help)
* Help text changes
* Unlimited FPS, nTexSize to Auto, nCanvasStretch to 100 and more...
* ...many and many bugs squashed.

Features added:
* Always On Top Feature (F7 Hotkey)
* Multiple monitor stretch (Thanks to @milkdropper for the code - ALT + S Hotkey) 
* Now it can support up to 16 custom shapes and waves!
* Real-time toggling FPS by pressing F3!
* New waveforms (from 8 to 15)
* Transparency Mode
* Spout Support (thanks @leadedge for helping me)
* Hardcut Modes (F11 Hotkey)

Features to be added:
* Toggle 3D Support
* Getting BeatDrop's Song Title data from Windows Playback
* Blending the visualizer with Webcam (Example: [Webcam > Spout > NestDrop on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NestDrop/comments/rh6zew/webcam_spout_nestdrop/) - F2 Hotkey
* Double Preset Mode
* Playback Hotkeys that can be controlled on any media players
* Pressing 'C' to add random values of ret /= float3(r, g, b); in the final of the comp shader code (with 30% chance to add ret /= float3(bass, mid, treb));
* New blending transitions

Before compiling the code:
* Anyone who uses Visual Studio 2019, please change from debug to release and build it.
