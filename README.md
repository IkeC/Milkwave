## History

The original [MilkDrop2](https://www.geisswerks.com/milkdrop/) WinAmp plugin created by Ryan Geiss was turned into a Windows standalone application by Maxim Volskiy as [BeatDrop](https://github.com/mvsoft74/BeatDrop) and has since been improved upon eg. in the [BeatDrop-Music-Visualizer](https://github.com/OfficialIncubo/BeatDrop-Music-Visualizer) and MilkDrop3 projects.

For a more detailed explanation of all features, please read the [Manual](https://github.com/IkeC/Milkwave/blob/main/Build/Manual.md).
