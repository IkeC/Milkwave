# milkdrop2-musikcube
a port of the amazing milkdrop2 visualizer to musikcube.

you'll need visual studio 2017 (community c++ edition) to compile this project.

most of the code was pulled straight from the [official Milkdrop2 source code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/milkdrop2/), but some was adapted from the [XBMC plugin](https://github.com/oO-MrC-Oo/Milkdrop2-XBMC).
